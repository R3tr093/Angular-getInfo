<h2 id="c1"> Prerequisites </h2><hr>

<p>For a good beginning, i will let you know you probably should have some soft skills with MongoDB, Angular, And express.</p>

<p>If you don't have any knowledge about these things, you should practice a little with them.  :wink: </p>

<p> Well, the first thing we have to do is to ensure we get an recent version of node on our system.<br>
    For the entire article, i use an Linux Debian operating system, i let you search about the same command on your operating system as well.</p>

<p> We need a version of node higher at the  8.0.0, i wrote this application under node version 10.16.0, you can install on the website below : </p>
